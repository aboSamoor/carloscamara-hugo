> There are two ways of constructing a software design: one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies; the other is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
â€“ C. A. R. Hoare

When reading [A byte of python](http://swaroopch.com/notes/Python/) by Swaroop C H, I found this quote being funny, well constructed and true.  The funniest thing in my opinion is that it can also be applied to many other areas apart from computer science, being politics one of the most evident.
