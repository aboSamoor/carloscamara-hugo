Although it had officially been announced several days ago, the [IND+I Science](http://indi.cat/indi-science/)[^INDI] awards ceremony took place yesterday, where I received the prize of the category **"Metropolitan innovation policies"** for my [doctoral research on urban commons]({{<ref "/publication/2018-comunes-urbanos-lecciones-desde-barcelona" >}}}). <!--more-->

During the perfectly organized event, each of the winners was able to briefly present their research, grouped into two blocks, which gave way to two very interesting debates although, as always happens to me in these cases, I had the feeling that they were too brief.

The event served not only to know the other four winners of the other categories and their research (as a tasting) but also to encourage interesting debates and even *networking*. All very much in line with IND+I's transfer objectives.

That is why I can only thank the IND+I Science team for several reasons. Firstly, for contributing with prizes and events like this to make science come out of offices and laboratories, reach the general public and, hopefully, can even be applied. Secondly,as Núria Vallès rightly pointed out, because it is a pleasure to see how the work we have been doing for years and which, is very often solitary, raises certain interest for someone. Thirdly, for contributing financially to the promotion of scientific research, which in recent years has suffered significant cuts. Personally, also for giving me the opportunity to make my research known and to meet the other four winners of the other categories and their research. All very much in line with IND+I's transfer objectives. Last but not least, for the organisation and the care with which we have been treated at all times.

I also take this opportunity to extend my thanks to the members of the PEMB, not only for sponsoring the prize in my category, but also because they were always very interested in my work and its dissemination. I hope to meet you again soon.

Without further ado, I'll leave you some tweets that summarize part of the intervention and the debate.
