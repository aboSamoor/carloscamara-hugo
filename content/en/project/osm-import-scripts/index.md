This is a proof of concept and a pet project for learning python while preparing data for importing it to [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org). Although I will start small (importing trees from Barcelona city council), I aim to set the foundations for adding other types of imports that may (or may not) be added in the future, hopefully with other people's contributions.

## Documentation

Project's documentation can be found in `docs` folder and a live version, generated using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), can be found [here](https://osmimports.mapcolabora.org).
