In 2014, the [Arquia Foundation](https://fundacion.arquia.es) initiated a divulgation project coordinated by Lorenzo Barnó and Agnieszka Stepien aimed to provide different perspectives on architecture in relation to the following thematic axes: Profession, Architecture and Society, Thought and Criticism, through a [collaborative blog](http://blogfundacion.arquia.es). I am proud to be one of those correspondants, writing about university studies, technology, maps and cities.
