Founded by myself and Dr. on Geography Miguel Sevilla in 2016, _[Collaborative Mapping](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmapcolabora.org)_ is an action-research group of enthusiasts aimed to foster citizen innovation and collective intelligence through Voluntary Geographic Informationand that result in collaborative maps at the service of citizens. We do so through participatory projects and periodical meetings and talks about tools, methodologies or related topics such as Free Culture and Informationalism paradigm. Some of our main achievements so far have been the organization of [Medecins Sans Frontieres](https://www.msf.org/)’s **Humanitarian Hackaton in Spain** (2017, 2018 and 2019), leading **Mapping parties** for [Accessible Zaragoza](/project/zaccesible) project, or giving a number of **[talks and workshops](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=es&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmapcolabora.org%23talks)** on VGI and tools such as Leaflet, Carto, Mapbox, OpenStreetMap, Overpass API, Mapillary, uMap...

Since then, I have been coordinating the group's activities as well with Dr. Miguel Sevilla-Callejo and Alejandro Suárez, Héctor Hochoa and Joan Cano, who joined the staff soon afterwards.
