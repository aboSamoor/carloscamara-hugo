abstract = " Although urbanism is something that concerns everybody, it has traditionally been something managed only by technicians and politicians and thus, citizens' needs and desires have not been taken into consideration in the decision-taking processes regarding cities' morphology. However, this may be about to change due to the increasing popularity about the so-called “Peer to peer urbanism”, which seems to have flourished in this second decade of the 21st century, and within the context of Network Society, has found an opportunity of development without precedents. Even though it may be in a very incipient stage, participative urbanism arises new ways of understanding cities, urbanism, governance and participation yet at the same time turns to be a challenge for public administrations and initiative's promoters and developers."
