abstract = "The working group Recuperem la ciutat was born as a joint effort of reflection and mobilization from the coincidence of interests and concerns of a group of professionals and academics from different backgrounds and disciplinary practices, which are linked as a result of a twitter debate promoted by URBSenacción, a section of the URBS magazine dedicated to promoting reflection activities through social networks. As a result of the debate, it was decided to organize a face-to-face meeting in the city of Valencia, as an opportunity to continue in an intensive way the shared reflection. Before and after the meeting, individual proposals were exchanged through an e-mail list, with the aim of proposing a first common theoretical framework and outlining some intervention strategies that would close the cycle of open reflection with the original debate. In this document we present the main reflections and conclusions developed in each of these activities, as well as the will to continue the work on future occasions."
