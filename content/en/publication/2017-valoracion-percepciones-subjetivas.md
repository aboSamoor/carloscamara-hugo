# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = " The assessment of social risk has traditionally been based on the quantification of objective data on demography, economy or morphology. At the project “Social Risk Map of Zaragoza” (MRSZ in Spanish) we are developing complementary methods that are focused on the importance of the various ways of living that take place in Zaragoza’s neighbourhoods. Part of that study is based on what we have named “Subjective Potential for Urban Auto-regeneration Index” (IPSAU in Spanish), obtained from the answers of a survey on subjective perceptions that citizens have about their neighbourhoods. This article’s goals are, hence, to explain how and why this index was obtained and, most importantly, to present its results, which will be compared to the ones provided by other similar studies that were previously developed in Zaragoza based on quantitative data."
