abstract = "Since the end of 2013, the Open Source Architectures research group at Universidad San Jorge's School of Architecture and Technology has been collaborating with the Professional Association of Social Workers of Aragon on the development of a Social Risk Map. This project, funded by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, aims to develop the Social Risk Map concept announced in the Aragon Regional Planning Act (2009). A mixed methodology has been designed to provide an alternative method for assessing areas and neighbourhoods in Zaragoza which are most sensitive to the loss of socio-community relations and their interrelation with the rest of the city. The goal is, firstly, to obtain a methodology that incorporates the social sphere as a platform from which to assess risks arising in the urbanized territory and, secondly, to be able to apply this methodology to other cities."
