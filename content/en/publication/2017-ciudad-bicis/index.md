abstract = """The technological development and proliferation of collaborative initiatives on the Internet has led to the emergence of OpenStreetMap, a free thematic mapping project aimed at distributing geographic data in an open manner. Compared to other online mapping services, OpenStreetMap has become the mapping platform used in many websites, it is being used in areas of humanitarian assistance, development aid, in the creation of alternative cartography - e.g. for people with some kind of disability - and it is being used to dump territorial information from local, regional or European services.

New technologies have also been applied to cycling, making quality geographical information on this means of transport essential. Mobile applications for calculating routes or monitoring physical activity are becoming increasingly common. In this sense, the origin, reliability and timeliness of the information handled is important.

This communication highlights the value of OpenStreetMap as a tool for the dissemination and diffusion of cycle paths and infrastructures related to cycling, taking the city of Zaragoza as an example.
