# Abstract.
abstract = "Geographic Information Systems provide a series of great opportunities to those professionals whose activity is related to the city and the territory, like urbanists and the like. Fully aware of this new reality, the Escuela de Arquitectura y Tecnología at Universidad San Jorge (from now on, EARTE and USJ, respectively) has started a series of actions aimed to the gradual introduction of such tools. One of those actions is the activity called “Mapping for an accessible Zaragoza”, which will be developed throughout this paper. The following pages will present its objectives, methodology and development in order to integrate ICT, GIS and accessibility for impaired people within the context of the 4th year's course Urban Studies 6"
