# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Can Information and Communication Technologies be tools for observing and acting on heritage and public space from a contemporary perspective? If, on the one hand, ICTs are very useful for measuring, knowing and representing heritage -from the use of APPs and crowsourcing to Big data and augmented reality- they are also useful for its dissemination and sharing and, therefore, its preservation. In the most recent times, moreover, the creation of cultural initiatives based on technology opens an important niche of innovation and creativity, starting also from the younger generations."
