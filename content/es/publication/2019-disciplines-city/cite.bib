  abstract = {Within a context of austerity, city governance policies have been devoted to attracting capital either from external sources or by a series of privatisation policies, submitting any kind of social concern to this mercantilist logic. In doing so, cities have turned into trading goods and mechanisms of dispossession that have resulted in an accentuation of social and economic inequities. It is no wonder, hence, that many voices have been raised claiming for fairer alternatives.
Urban commons propose a possible response to that demand. This article offers a theoretical approach aimed to improve the comprehension of such a suggestive, yet ambiguous, term that gathers many diverse and diffuse aspirations. Centered around the ideals of sharing amongst peers, self-governance, equity and solidarity, urban commons advocate for a social and spatial justice that will be achieved by means of sharing specific endangered parts of the city.},
